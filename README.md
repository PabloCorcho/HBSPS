# HBSPS
HBSPS (Hierarchical Bayesian Stellar Population Synthesis) is a stellar population synthesis code that was designed for inferring the initial mass function (IMF) and other properties from the spectra of unresolved stellar populations.

For instructions on how to use the HBSPS, please read the manual (manual.pdf).

If you use this code in your work, please reference the following papers:
* Dries et al., 2016, MNRAS, 463, 886
* Dries et al., 2018, MNRAS, 474, 3500
  
If you use the stellar templates that come along with HBSPS, please reference the following original papers on which these templates are based:
* MILES library
  Sanchez-Blazquez et al., 2006, MNRAS, 371, 703
* Parsec isochrones
  Bressan et al., 2012, MNRAS, 427,127
* stitched isochrones
